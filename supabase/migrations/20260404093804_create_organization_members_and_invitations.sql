  # Create Organization Members and Invitations Tables

  1. New Tables
    - `organization_members`
      - `id` (uuid, primary key) - Unique member record identifier
      - `organization_id` (uuid) - Reference to organizations table
      - `profile_id` (uuid) - Reference to profiles table
      - `role_id` (uuid) - Reference to roles table
      - `invited_by` (uuid, nullable) - Reference to profiles table (who invited this member)
      - `joined_at` (timestamptz) - When the member joined
      - `created_at` (timestamptz) - Record creation timestamp

    - `invitations`
      - `id` (uuid, primary key) - Unique invitation identifier
      - `organization_id` (uuid) - Reference to organizations table
      - `email` (text) - Email address of invitee
      - `role_id` (uuid) - Role to assign upon acceptance
      - `invited_by` (uuid) - Reference to profiles table (who sent the invite)
      - `token` (text, unique) - Secure invitation token (hashed)
      - `status` (enum) - pending, accepted, expired, cancelled
      - `expires_at` (timestamptz) - Expiration timestamp
      - `accepted_at` (timestamptz, nullable) - When invitation was accepted
      - `created_at` (timestamptz) - Creation timestamp

  2. Security
    - Enable RLS on both tables
    - Unique constraint: one profile per organization
    - Unique partial index: one pending invitation per email per organization
    - Users can view members of their organization
    - Admins can manage invitations for their organization

  3. Features
    - Automatic token generation
    - 7-day expiry by default
    - Prevent duplicate memberships
    - Audit trail of who invited whom
